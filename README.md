# CMPM-121-Final-Project-Repo

Collaborative repo for cmpm-121 final project.

## Introducing the team

Aryan Sidbatte: Engine Lead

Angelo Franso: Testing Lead

Edward Garcia: Tools Lead

Ethan Morelos: Design Lead

Devin Alvarez: Tools, design

## Tools and materials

### Tools: Codespaces + Live Share

We are familiar with their collaborative capabilities and we think this will make it easy to work with each other from anywhere.
Our focus will be using 3D editors that we have not committed to yet for our scenes and visual assets.
Github will definitely be used to push our commits. Github desktop would most likely be recommended for ease on every member.
Codespaces will be our editor for the ability to work together using Live Share.

### Language: TypeScript, CSS

We decided to use TypeScript because of our familiarity using it throughout this quarter. Typescript can help with our chosen engines. JavaScript has been used for these engines but Typescript can help with type confirmation and other tools associated with it.
We will use CSS for styling and clarity on our projections and UI/UX.

### Engine (Libraries) : Three.js, Ammo.js


Since we chose to use TypeScript these libraries are our only way of accessing 3D graphics. Though we have not used it before, this is probably the best way to access 3D graphics in this format. We will also have our tools lead and our agentic tools if we ever need help using them. Copilot will be a big help when using these libraries as it already has access to our files and we can ask it the best ways to utilize the libraries in our circumstances.

### Generative AI: Brace, ChatGPT, Copilot

We are using Copilot because it is already built-in to Codespaces. This will help if we need any quick edits and to catch errors in our file. From experience, Copilot sometimes has problems accomplishing certain tasks, which is why we are including the use of Brace and ChatGPT. These tools will help us complete harder tasks and also to help format our code. Catching code smells is also better on these outside AI chatbots which is good for refinements once we’re done with our project.

## Outlook

*What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?*

Choosing a tool that may not work for our purposes down the line & switching tools (redoing a lot of work) is likely the riskiest part of this project. Liveshare may also hinder progress due to it being buggy and messing with the spelling of members code.

*What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?*

We hope to improve our collaborative skills and make use of new collaborative tools. Become more familiar with TypeScript and using libraries available as well as maintaining good GitHub techniques. Being able to plan out a large project from the ground up in a timely manner with the least amount of issues as possible. Essentially, we hope to practice the skills we have learned so far while strengthening them to develop a game that is presentable.
